# jGemNap

jGemNap is something I wrote many many years ago for my Napco Gemini 3200 home security system.
It should also work for the Napco Gemini 9600 although I have not tested it.
I bought one of these systems in the early 2000s for my home, installed it and set about trying to 
program it. My plan was to build a tiny website that I could access from my very basic HTML-enabled
cell phone where I could then arm, disarm, view status etc of my home alarm system.
I had never coded Java so it was partly an exercise to to learn Java. The code here was never intended 
to be read by someone else; it was very much 'slap something together to see if I can get anything
working'. Also, Napco weren't exactly going to publish their inner workings to the web so it took
some investigation on my part to find the serial protocol used by this system. I have included 
some text files under the Gemini folder which can help with this.

I know there are still a lot of these systsems floating around out there and that this code is of
interest to some. If it is a help to your home project then I am happy.

Enjoy!
